# TrackStudio
TrackStudio is an interactive open-source toolkit for markerless tracking. It provides a visual interface enabling trimming of videos, synchronising between cameras, using MediaPipe and Anipose for 2D and 3D tracking (including camera calibration) with result visualisation, without the requirement of any coding. It is aimed at any user regardless of their technical level of expertise. Advanced users can still enhance the utility of the toolkit and easily replace the methods used for 2D and 3D markerless tracking (see "Code Architecture" section below).

Check out the [TrackStudio paper](https://www.biorxiv.org) for detailed information on how to install and use TrackStudio and general advice on markerless tracking video recordings and setup.

Below is included further information on multi-camera recording setups in OBS, light-based approach for cameras synchronisation, and details on code implementation.
